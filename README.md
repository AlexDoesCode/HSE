eCommerce test assignment

Hi Manuel, 
so this is it or at least all that I've been able to achive during that week.
There are a lot more possible features that could have been implemented 
but that would be hard to do taking into account the time frame I had :P

I have to admit that my solution is not perfect and there are some known flows and assumptions
for which I had not time to cleanup:
  1. I haven't added a navigator component so navigation is a bit hacky
  2. Presenter tests are yellow sometimes - very weird issue which happens rarely
     (I suspect that the test execution somehow finishes earlier than assertion result is received...to be investigated)
  3. I had no relevant spec. for your server so I don't guarantee the data consistency, but I tried to do my best learning it
     just by trying to receive `json` objects and making my own assumptions.
  4. No bottom bar (for cart?) and top one also (for back button?), just ran out of time, sorry :(
      tip. You can steel use a hardware back button functionality.
  5. Designing UI\UX is not my best skill so please deal with what you get :)
  6. Please message me via any channel so I'll be informed about the fact you have read this.
 
Looking forward to meeting you tomorrow!
Cheers. Alex.
